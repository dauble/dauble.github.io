---Reference WordPress Dashicons in CSS------/post/reference-wordpress-dashicons-css.html------Thu, 20 Jul 2017 13:24:20------Recently I had an issue where I needed to remove a mega menu plugin in order to improve a site's PageSpeed score. In breaking it down, I realized the plugin was referencing the WordPress Dashicons, something I would need to add in when rebuilding the navigation menu.

                I looked online and finally found the solution: load the dashicons from the functions.php file.
                <blockquote>add_action( 'wp_enqueue_scripts', 'load_dashicons_front_end' );

                function load_dashicons_front_end() {
                wp_enqueue_style( 'dashicons' );
                }</blockquote>
                Then, in your CSS, simply reference them as a new font:
                <blockquote>.item {
                content: '\f140';
                display: inline-block;
                font-family: dashicons;
                }</blockquote>
                I found this snippet from <a href="https://wpsites.net/web-design/adding-dashicons-in-wordpress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WP Sites</a>.
