---Embedding Google Maps: 'X-Frame-Options' to 'sameorigin'------/post/embedding-google-maps-x-frame-options-sameorigin.html------Fri, 25 Aug 2017 02:50:59------This past week, I came across something odd. I was building a real-estate website for a client and the client requested a Google Maps embed of specific property. Simple, right? Not entirely.

                I was able to locate the address and embed an iframe dynamically by using the following code:
                <blockquote>&lt;iframe
                width="100%"
                height="350"
                frameborder="0" style="border:0"
                src="http://maps.google.com/?q=&lt;?php echo $address; ?&gt;&amp;output=embed" allowfullscreen&gt;
                &lt;/iframe&gt;</blockquote>
                However, when I'd refresh my browser, I kept getting two console errors:
                <blockquote>Refused to display 'https://www.google.com/maps?q=The+Address' in a frame because it set 'X-Frame-Options' to 'sameorigin'.</blockquote>
                and
                <blockquote>Failed to load resource: net::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_RESPONSE</blockquote>
                Hmm..

                After some digging though, I found out all I had to do was appendÂ <strong>&amp;output=embed</strong> at the end of the address and it'd magically work.

                So, the final embed now looks like this:
                <blockquote>&lt;iframe
                width="100%"
                height="350"
                frameborder="0" style="border:0"
                src="http://maps.google.com/?q=&lt;?php echo $address; ?&gt;&amp;output=embed" allowfullscreen&gt;
                &lt;/iframe&gt;</blockquote>------/assets/images/posts/blog-map.jpg------Array---
